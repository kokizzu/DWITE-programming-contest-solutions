		<h2>Cubes in a Pyramid</h2>
		<p>A pyramid is to be constructed out of stone cubes, <em>1 meter in length each</em>. The pyramid will have a square base and be completely solid. Given the dimensions for the length of the base and the height of the pyramid, and assuming that no material is wasted, calculate the minimum number of cube stones required to construct a pyramid of the supplied dimensions.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain two lines with one real value on each line, L and H; 0.00 &lt; L, H â‰¤ 100.00 representing the (L)ength of the base and the (H)eight of the pyramid to be constructed.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain a single integer, representing the minimum number of blocks required for the construction.</p>
