			<div id="problem_title">Floor Plan</div>
			<p>A common way to value a house, among other things, is by the area of the rooms. Though, it could be less than trivial to accurately calculate the area of a room that is not in a standard shape. Given a floor plan diagram, with rooms of interest marked, their areas should be calculated.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain two lines with one integer value each, R,C; 0 &lt; R, C â‰¤ 40, representing the number of <em>rows</em> and <em>columns</em> that make up the floor plan. This is followed by R lines showing the floor plan layout, where:</p>
			<ul>
				<li># - wall</li>
				<li>. - open space</li>
				<li>{1..5} - integers 1 to 5, marking rooms of interest</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines. Each line will have an integer representing the area of a room of interest. The first line should contain the area of room 1, second line of room 2, etc.</p>
			<p>The area of the room is defined as 1 + number of reachable open spaces. The integer marker could appear anywhere inside the room.</p>
