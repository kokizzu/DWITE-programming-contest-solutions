<div id="problem_title">All Is Balanced</div>

<p>Parentheses are important characters in programming -- they define the order of operations and organize information. That is, as long as they are properly balanced. Parentheses are <em>balanced</em> when the opening and closing brackets match with one another, and are themselves nested within balanced parentheses.</p>
<p>This is perhaps best illustrated in examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>( ) - balanced: opening is matched with a closing</li>
<li>( ( ) - not balanced: one of the opening brackets has no match</li>
<li>( [ ) ] - not balanced: the contents inside of ( ) are not balanced</li>
</ul>
<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each no more than 255 characters long. Valid characters are any of the three parenthesis types: <strong>()</strong>, <strong>[]</strong>, <strong>{}</strong>, and any alphanumeric characters: <strong>a-z0-9</strong>.</p>
<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each stating either <em>"balanced"</em> or <em>"not balanced"</em> for the supplied expressions. Use the exact string output, all lower case, without quotes.</p>
<p>All of the characters but the parentheses could effectively be ignored. Keep in mind the different types of parentheses -- an opening bracket needs to be matched with a closing bracket of the same type.</p>
