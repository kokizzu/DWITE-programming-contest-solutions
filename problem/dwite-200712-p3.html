<p>
There's a library full of legally purchased music and a shiny new MP3 player that needs to be filled with the best possible playlist. Every song comes with a rating from 0 to 5 (inclusive) and takes up a certain amount of space. The <em>best</em> playlist is defined as the one with the highest total of rating points that still fits into the allowable space.
</p>
<p>
The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain five data sets. The first line will contain the space available in the player, a positive integer. The second line will specify the size of the music library, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100. This is followed by N lines in the form <strong>title rating space</strong>. The title will be a unique single string (no spaces). Rating is an integer from 0 to 5. Space is an integer, 1 &lt;= S &lt;= 30000. This is followed by the next data set.
</p>
<p>
The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain five lines, each containing an integer -- the max sum of ratings that can fit on the player.
