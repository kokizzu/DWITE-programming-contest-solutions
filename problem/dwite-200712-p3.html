			<p>There’s a library full of legally purchased music and a shiny new MP3 player that needs to be filled with the best possible playlist. Every song comes with a rating from 0 to 5 (inclusive) and takes up a certain amount of space. The <em>best</em> playlist is defined as the one with the highest total of rating points that still fits into the allowable space.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain five data sets. The first line will contain the space available in the player, a positive integer. The second line will specify the size of the music library, 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 100. This is followed by <var>N</var> lines in the form <var>title</var> <var>rating</var> <var>space</var>. The title will be a unique single string (no spaces). Rating is an integer from 0 to 5. Space is an integer, 1 ≤ <var>S</var> ≤ 30000. This is followed by the next data set.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain five lines, each containing an integer – the max sum of ratings that can fit on the player.</p>
