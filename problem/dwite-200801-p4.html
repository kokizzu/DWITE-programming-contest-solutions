		<h2>Shortest path around</h2>
		<p>Sometimes an open field could be as much of a maze as narrow tunnels. Given an obstacle in an otherwise empty room, what is the shortest path around it?</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain five sets of data, each a 10 by 10 character matrix. There will be a line of 10 dashes after each set to visually delimit sets of data. The character representations are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>. - empty space</li>
			<li># - wall</li>
			<li>X - one of the ends</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain five lines â€“ each an integer distance between the two points marked with X.</p>
		<p>There will always be only two X spots per set. There will always be a valid path. Valid steps are into any adjacent empty space; <em>diagonal steps are legal</em>. Refer to the sample data for examples.</p>
