		<h2>Number of factors</h2>
		<p>Integer numbers are made up of <em>factors</em>, which are the smallest numbers that when multiplied together form the original number. Factors are always prime. 1 and the original number itself don’t count as factors. If a number has no factors, then that number is itself prime. For example, 12 is made up of three factors: 2*2*3 (even though 4*3 is 12, 4 itself has two factors: 2*2).</p>
		<p>We care about this because factors are often involved in cryptography:</p>
		<blockquote><p>When the numbers are very large, no efficient integer factorization algorithm is publicly known; a recent effort which factored a 200-digit number (RSA-200) took eighteen months and used over half a century of computer time.</p></blockquote>
		<p>Though we’ll be dealing with <em>much</em> smaller numbers for now.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 2 ≤ N ≤ 32.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines – the total number of factors in the number.</p>
