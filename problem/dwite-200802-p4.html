			<p>You are trying to navigate a complicated train system to arrive at your destination in the quickest time possible. Given a system’s schematic with start and end points, calculate the shortest length possible.</p>
			<p>The schematic will be made up of a number of characters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>S – start point</li>
				<li>E – end point</li>
				<li>just about any other character – path connecting the stations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It doesn’t really matter what character represents the path. Consider the schematic to be a 2D array where every character with the exception of space and x is a valid path point. <em>Diagonal moves are allowed.</em> So every point has 8 possible connection points, and that connection is made if both characters are valid.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of data – <var>N</var> lines per set, 10 characters in per line, and each set being terminated by a line of ‘x’ characters. 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 5. Each set represents a system schematic as described above.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines – the minimum travel length between S and E points.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> The dataset will contain a lot of whitespace, instead of typical dots. Make sure you can handle this data properly.</p>
