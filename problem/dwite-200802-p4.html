		<p>
			You are trying to navigate a complicated train system to arrive at your destination in the quickest time possible. Given a system's schematic with start and end points, calculate the shortest length possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			The schematic will be made up of a number of characters:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>S - start point</li>
			<li>E - end point</li>
			<li>just about any other character - path connecting the stations</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It doesn't really matter what character represents the path. Consider the schematic to be a 2D array where every character with the exception of space and x is a valid path point. <strong>Diagonal moves are allowed.</strong> So every point has 8 possible connection points, and that connection is made if both characters are valid.
		</p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of data -- N lines per set, 10 characters in per line, and each set being separated by a line of 'x' characters. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5. Each set represents a system schematic as described above.</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines -- the minimum travel length between S and E points.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Note:</em> The dataset will contain a lot of whitespace, instead of typical dots. Make sure you can handle this data properly.
