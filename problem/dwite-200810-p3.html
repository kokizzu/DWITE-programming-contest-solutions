			<p>Given this overly imaginative layout of a tiny five-room floorplan (one of which happens to be missing a door), the letters ABCDEFGHIJKL mark the points of interest. Given a daily schedule as a sequence of letters, how much would one have to walk while taking the most optimal paths?</p>
			<p>Walking is done on periods (.) and letters. There is no diagonal movement. <em>For reference:</em> The distance between B to F is <em>6</em>. From F to J is <em>4</em>. And so the path BFJE will be <em>16</em>. If a letter is consecutively followed by itself (such as BB), the distance is <em>0</em>.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain 10 lines, a copy of the <em>same map</em> as presented above. It will be followed by 5 more lines, each being a string made up of the aforementioned capital letters (ABCDEFGHIJKL), 1 ≤ <var>N</var> &lt; 20 in length, describing the schedule.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines – the optimal distance travelled for the plan specified.</p>
