		<p>Given this overly-imaginative layout of a tiny 5-room floorplan (one of which happens to be missing a door), the letters ABCDEFGHIJKL mark the points of interest. Given a daily schedule as a sequence of letters, how much would one have to walk while taking the most optimal paths?</p>
		<p>Walking is done on periods (.) and letters. There are no diagonal movement. <em>For reference:</em> The distance between B to F is <strong>6</strong>. From F to J is <strong>4</strong>. And so the path BFJE will be <strong>16</strong>. If a letter is consecutively followed by itself (such as BB), the distance is 0.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain 10 lines, a copy of the <strong>same map</strong> as presented above. It will be followed by 5 more lines, each being a string made up of the aforementioned capital letters (ABCDEFGHIJKL), 1 ≤ N &lt; 20 in length, describing the schedule.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines – the optimal distance travelled for the plan specified.</p>
