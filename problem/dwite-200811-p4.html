		<p>Having acquired more (totally legitimate) music than a tiny iPod Nano can hold (it's a first generation 2 GB model, so that's plausible) and wanting to load music in full albums only, this has posed quite a challenge for deciding on the playlists. To complicate the matters further, the disk space is shared with other data, so it fluctuates from time to time. This calls for some <em>Computer Science</em>.</p>

		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. The first line is the space available, an integer value 1 &lt;= S &lt;= 100. The second line is an integer N, the number of albums in the library, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 20. The next N lines describe the albums -- the space required and total utility; both are integer values, separated by a space; 1 &lt;= space, utility &lt;= 1000. Each set is separated by a newline.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each being the sum of the maximum utility that could fit given the associated input.</p>
		<p><em>Note:</em> Each album can appear only once in the playlist, though space-utility values are not guaranteed to be unique.</p>
