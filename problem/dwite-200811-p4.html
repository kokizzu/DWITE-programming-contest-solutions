			<p>Having acquired more (totally legitimate) music than a tiny iPod Nano can hold (it’s a first-generation 2&#xA0;<abbr title="gigabyte">GB</abbr> model, so that’s plausible) and wanting to load music in full albums only, this has posed quite a challenge for deciding on the playlists. To complicate matters further, the disk space is shared with other data, so it fluctuates from time to time. This calls for some <em>Computer Science</em>.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. The first line is the space available, an integer value 1 ≤ <var>S</var> ≤ 100. The second line is an integer <var>N</var>, the number of albums in the library, 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 20. The next <var>N</var> lines describe the albums – the space required and total utility; both are integer values, separated by a space character; 1 ≤ <var>space</var>, <var>utility</var> ≤ 1000. Each set is separated by a newline.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each being the sum of the maximum utility that could fit given the associated input.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> Each album can appear only once in the playlist, though (<var>space</var>, <var>utility</var>) values are not guaranteed to be unique.</p>
