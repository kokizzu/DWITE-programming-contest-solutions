			<p>There’s an essay due in class, and your teacher demands at least a certain minimum length for your paper. Caring more about optimization than the subject of ancient history, a word count tool would come in handy and save you from writing any more words than you need to.</p>
			<p>Knowing that your teacher counts only the words that are more than three letters long (having a similar software tool of her own), your program would need to do just that – count the words that are at least 4 letters long.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each a line of English text, no more than 255 characters in length.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 integer values – the count of words over 3 letters long, in each line.</p>
			<section class="sample">
				<div class="input">
					Sample Input:
					<pre>DWITE question number two: Wordcount++
Note how "two:" does not count.
For simplicity - "don't" is two words, split by apostrophe.

That was a blank line above.</pre>
