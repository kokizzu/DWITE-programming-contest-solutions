		<p>
			There's an essay due in class, and your teacher demands at least a certain minimum length for your paper. Caring more about optimization than the subject of ancient history, a word count tool would come in handy and save you from writing any more words than you need to.
		</p>
    <p>
      Knowing that your teacher counts only the words that are more than three letters long (having a similar software tool of her own), your program would need to do just that -- count the words that are at least 4 letters long.
    </p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each a line of English text, no more than 255 characters in length.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 integer values -- the count of words over 3 letters long, in each line.

		        <pre>
DWITE question number two: Wordcount++
Note how "two:" does not count.
For simplicity - "don't" is two words, split by apostrophe.

That was a blank line above.
