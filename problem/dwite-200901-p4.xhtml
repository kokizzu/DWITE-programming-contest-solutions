			<p>Sometimes an open field could be as much of a maze as narrow tunnels. Given an obstacle in an otherwise empty room, what is the shortest path around it?</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain five sets of data, each an 8-by-8 character map. The character representations are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>. – empty space</li>
				<li># – wall</li>
				<li>A – start</li>
				<li>B – end</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain five lines, each being the shortest integer distance between A and B.</p>
			<p><em>Notes:</em> There will always be a valid path. Valid steps are into any adjacent empty space; <em>diagonal steps are valid</em>. Refer to the sample data for examples.</p>
