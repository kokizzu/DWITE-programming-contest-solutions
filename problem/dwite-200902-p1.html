			<p>While <strong>diff</strong> is a useful text-processing utility that finds the differences between the contents of files, this <em>baby diff</em> will start out as a simplistic check, counting how many of the leading characters of two lines of text are the same. The hopes and dreams of this program are to grow up into a full-fledged utility, but for now, it starts small.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input, two lines each. Each line will be a non-empty string less than 255 characters long.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, integers 0 ≤ <var>i</var> ≤ 255 – the number of leading characters that are the same between the two lines, up to the first difference.</p>
			<p>Note that the two lines could be of different lengths. The counter stops before the first character that doesn’t match, so two strings that start differently would have a result of 0. Make sure not to count line break characters such as \n, \r, or a combination thereof.</p>
