		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>cd</strong>, sometimes also available as chdir (change directory), is a command-line command to change the current working directory in operating systems such as Unix, DOS, OS/2 and Windows.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input, 2 lines each. The first line of input will be a string representing the current location in the file system. The second will be a path to be taken relative to the starting location. All strings (including the output) will be non-empty and less than 255 characters.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each corresponding to the new working directory of the input set.</p>
		<p>You may assume that all directories exist and that the given paths are valid. For those unfamiliar with traversing directory structures on a computer, the key points are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>./ – current directory</li>
			<li>../ – directory that’s a step above</li>
			<li>any_word/ – directory a step below</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Example:</em> If the working directory is <strong>/one/two/</strong>, it means that there is a root directory <strong>/</strong> which contains a directory <strong>one/</strong> which, in turn, contains another directory <strong>two/</strong>. If we were to change directories as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>./</strong> – we’d stay where we are: <strong>/one/two/</strong></li>
			<li><strong>././</strong> – we’d continue to stay in <strong>/one/two/</strong></li>
			<li><strong>../</strong> – move one above: <strong>/one/</strong></li>
			<li><strong>../../</strong> – move two above: <strong>/</strong></li>
			<li><strong>../../../</strong> – move three above. One can’t move higher than root, so the result will stay at <strong>/</strong></li>
			<li><strong>../three/./</strong> – move up one, change directory to "three", and stay there: <strong>/one/three/</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Sanity check:</em> the first and last character of your output will <strong>always</strong> be a forward slash (/).</p>
