			Having decided to capitalize on your awesome programming skills, you've set out to create and sell a mobile application at $0.99 per copy. Since the application is hosted and distributed through a managed platform, the store gets to keep 30% from each sale.
		</p>
        <p>
            Given that you have an idea of how much profit you want to make off your hard work, <strong>at least</strong> how many thousands of copies must be sold? <em>(That is, the answer is rounded to the next 1000).</em>
        </p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 0 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000,000; the minimum profit you want to keep.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integer value of number of copies needed to be sold, rounded to the next 1000.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>For example:</em> if you want to make $1000, then (1444 copies * $0.99) - 30% = $1000.692. (1443 copies will earn below $1000). 1444 rounded to the next 1000 is 2000; thus the answer is 2000.
