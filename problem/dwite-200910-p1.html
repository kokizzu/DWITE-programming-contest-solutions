		<p>Having decided to capitalize on your awesome programming skills, you’ve set out to create and sell a mobile application at $0.99 per copy. Since the application is hosted and distributed through a managed platform, the store gets to keep 30% from each sale.</p>
		<p>Given that you have an idea of how much profit you want to make off your hard work, <strong>at least</strong> how many thousands of copies must be sold? <em>(That is, the answer is rounded to the next 1000).</em></p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 0 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000; the minimum profit you want to keep.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integer value of number of copies needed to be sold, rounded to the next 1000.</p>
		<p><em>For example:</em> if you want to make $1000, then (1444 copies * $0.99) − 30% = $1000.692. (1443 copies will earn below $1000). 1444 rounded to the next 1000 is 2000; thus the answer is 2000.</p>
