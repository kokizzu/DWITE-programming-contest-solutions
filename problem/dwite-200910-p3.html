			<p>You have a consecutive sequence of unique numbers, 1 to <var>N</var>, that you like very much, but your little sister always steals one (and only one), and randomly rearranges the rest in an attempt to hide the crime. Given <var>N</var>−1 numbers, in a random order, find out which number was taken.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. The first line will be an integer 1 ≤ <var>M</var> ≤ 100, the number of items remaining. This is followed by <var>M</var> lines of unique integers, from at least 1 to at most <var>M</var>+1.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each being the integer missing from the set.</p>
			<p><em>Note: The original sorted sequence is {1, 2, 3,..., <var>N</var>−1, <var>N</var>}. Any of the numbers (including 1 or <var>N</var>) can be taken.</em></p>
