		<p>
			Given a directional graph (think of it as a map of one way streets), cycles (a loop) are often involved in various problems. We know that one (and only one) cycle exists, and we want to find its length.
		</p>

		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA5.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. The first line will contain a single integer, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100, the number of pairs describing the graph. This is followed by N lines, each having two integers separated by a space. Each of the integers refers to a node, with a directional path from first to second. Node IDs are between 1 and 100, inclusive. <strong>The first node in the list is guaranteed to have a path to the cycle.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <em>For example:</em> If the graph is described by 4 pairs: 1 2, 2 3, 3 1, 4 5; Then it describes a disjoint graph -- a cycle of length 3 and another pair of nodes. Since it's guaranteed that starting at Node 1 will lead to a cycle, it shouldn't matter that it's not connected to 4 or 5.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <em>Note:</em> a node could link to itself (1 -> 1) and that will form a cycle of size 1.

			The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each an integer size of the cycle found in a graph.
