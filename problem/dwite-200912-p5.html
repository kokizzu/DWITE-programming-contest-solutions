			One of the ways to print T-shirt designs is by a process called <strong>screen printing</strong> -- a design is broken up into <em>"screens"</em> that allow paint to fill certain solid regions. This results in a higher quality print, but requires additional setup (and thus cost) for every colour used.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Having started what we hope to turn out to be a successful T-shirt design company, we want to minimize the printing costs. Each design can be modelled as a graph, and we want to be able to colour it such that no two adjacent nodes are of the same colour (think of it as a map of countries -- every country border has two different colours). <strong>What is the minimum number of colours that each design requires?</strong>. <em>Let's assume that paying for more than 4 is too much, so if we can't colour it in 4, we'll give up.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA5.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. First line will contain a positive integer 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 20, number of edges in a graph, followed by N lines describing the graph. Each such line will contain two positive integers, separated by a single space -- a connection between two nodes identified by such integers. If both node IDs are the same, treat it as a disconnected node (there is no edge to itself).
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, the minimum number of colours required to colour the graph, <em>or</em> 0 if 4 is not enough.
