			<p>As social media gets more popular, there are all kinds of people beginning to join online social networks. Some want to better connect with their friends, others amass a following to spam to with the links to their blog (on the topics of amassing online followings...), while yet another group has relapsed into their childhood memories of <em>catching them all</em>. At what point does <em>“friending”</em> turn into a game? Let’s try to find out.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 9000, each being a number of “friends” in one’s social network.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each corresponding to the corresponding result, an integer (rounded to the closest whole number) number of minutes each “friend” gets dedicated to them per month, assuming a month means 30 days, and every day there are 5 hours of solid non-stop online socializing happening with this particular network.</p>
			<p><em>For example:</em> There are 30×5 = 150 hours of available time, so for those with 150 contacts, each contact gets, on average, just 1 hour (60 minutes) of personal attention a month.</p>
