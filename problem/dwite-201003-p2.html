		<p>More from the series of <i>round to closest obscure function</i> – round to the closest <strong>second</strong> prime. That is, "round" an integer to a closest prime number such that there is exactly one other prime number between the original input and the result. If the input integer itself is a prime, it is still rounded (the requirement of having a prime in between). If there are two primes equally far away that both satisfy the condition, then the larger one is the answer.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 5 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 100</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integer answers to corresponding lines of input.</p>
		<p><em>Example:</em> input is 7 (which incidentally is a prime). The two primes around it are 5 and 11. The two <strong>second</strong> primes around that are 3 and 13. 3 is closer to 7 than 13 is, so <var>r</var>(7) == 3</p>
