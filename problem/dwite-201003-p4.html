			<p>Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of extracting textual information from images. While the current technology is mostly software-based, rather than using optical devices, the term has stuck around.</p>
			<p>For the problem, we’ll work with a very simple alphabet, with each letter strictly defined by a 2×2 or 3×2 bitmap.</p>
			<pre>A: x.
   xx

B: xx
   xx
    
C: x.x
   xxx

D: xx
   .x

E: xxx
   .xx</pre>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets, each 2 lines long, each line at least 2 and no more than 30 characters long. A set will spell out some word in the above alphabet. It will always be a valid word, and it will not be ambiguous (in a way that only one possible word could make the design pattern).</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output – the recognized words.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> You would need to take a word as a whole to distinguish between some of the cases. <em>For example:</em> In the sample below, while the first character could be read as C, the rest of the word would not be made of valid characters.</p>
