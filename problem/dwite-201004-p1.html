			<p><strong>ROT13</strong>, as in <em>“rotate by 13”</em>, is a really simple cipher algorithm that just advances every letter by 13 places, wrapping around from Z to A. Since applying the algorithm twice would advance each letter by 26 places, it has a really neat property that encryption and decryption are the same function.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each being a string that is 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 250 characters long.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines – corresponding strings that were run through the ROT13 function once.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> The character rotation should apply <em>only to alphabetic characters</em>. Spaces, digits, and punctuation should stay as is.</p>
