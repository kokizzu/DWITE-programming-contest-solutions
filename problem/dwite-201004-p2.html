		<p>Yet another <em>"round to arbitrary sequence"</em> question – <strong>powers of 2</strong>. Given a non-negative integer, what is the closest integer that is also an integer power of 2? This one actually might have some potential application, as integer powers of 2 are represented by a single bit in a digital sequence – numbers that are the easiest to work with in digital circuits, so we might want to approximate some numbers to work with "easier" numbers instead.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 0 ≤ N ≤ 65536</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, corresponding integers rounded to the closest integer power of 2. If there are two integers equally far away, then use the higher value for the answer.</p>
		<p>The sequence starts as: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 2<sup>n</sup></p>
