			<p>Congratulations, you’ve landed a paid co-op position and can start working on gaining work experience and paying off all of those student loans... but the job is far, and air travel is expensive. Looking to squeeze a few extra dollars in savings, the quest is to find the cheapest possible flight, even if that requires multiple connections.</p>
			<p>The flight search is to go from YYZ to SEA.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA5.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input. Each set starts with an integer 1 &lt; <var>N</var> ≤ 20 – the size of the available data. This is followed by <var>N</var> lines describing the available flights, in the form of <var>CODE1</var> <var>CODE2</var> <var>price</var>. Codes are 3-character-long airport codes, and the prices are positive integer values.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, which are integer values for the cheapest total flights for each scenario.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> There will always be a possible flight path.</p>
			<p><em>Note 2:</em> The flights are described in a single direction. That is, “SEA YYZ 1” cannot be taken to go <em>from</em> YYZ <em>to</em> SEA.</p>
