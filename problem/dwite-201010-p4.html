			<div id="problem_title">Planting Trees</div>
			<p>You are considering planting trees around your house, but there are only a few good sites to do so. Furthermore, it would be best if the planted trees surrounded the house – that is, the house is within the area formed between all the trees.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of input, an integer 3 ≤ N ≤ 30, followed by N lines of integer <strong>X Y</strong> pairs, -1000 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000, describing possible plant locations. Consider the house to be a single point at location 0,0.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, an integer number of possible valid configurations for exactly 3 trees.</p>
			<p><em>Notes:</em> the order in which the trees are planted does not matter. The house must be <strong>strictly contained</strong> within the area; that is, if the house is exactly on the line between two trees, then this configuration does not count.</p>
