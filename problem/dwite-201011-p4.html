		<p>In math class, writing fractions in their decimal form was a common task. However, the teachers would usually have you round off the number to a certain number of decimal places. But all fractions have a nice property: in decimal form, they all either terminate or repeat in a pattern. For example, the fraction 1/10 terminates, as 1/10 = 0.1. However, the fraction 1/3 repeats, as 1/3 = 0.333... = 0.(3) (note that the repeated part is parenthesized). Given a fraction, output its decimal form, parenthesizing the cyclic part of the fraction, if such exists.</p>

		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each a pair of integers 1 &lt;= N &lt; D &lt;= 400, separated by a single space.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, the decimal forms of N/D, truncating and parenthesizing the repeating digits, if such is the case.</p>
		<p><em>Note:</em> the answers must match exactly and use shortest repeating pattern. Since D is always greater than N, all of the answers are less than 1.0</p>
