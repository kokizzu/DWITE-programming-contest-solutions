			<p>In math class, writing fractions in their decimal form was a common task. However, the teachers would usually have you round off the number to a certain number of decimal places. But all fractions have a nice property: In decimal form, they all either terminate or repeat in a pattern. For example, the fraction 1/10 terminates, as 1/10 = 0.1. However, the fraction 1/3 repeats, as 1/3 = 0.333... = 0.(3) (note that the repeated part is parenthesized). Given a fraction, output its decimal form, parenthesizing the cyclic part of the fraction if such exists.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each a pair of integers 1 ≤ <var>N</var> &lt; <var>D</var> ≤ 400, separated by a single space.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, the decimal forms of <var>N</var>/<var>D</var>, truncating and parenthesizing the repeating digits if such is the case.</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> The answers must match exactly and use the shortest repeating pattern. Since <var>D</var> is always greater than <var>N</var>, all of the answers are less than 1.0.</p>
