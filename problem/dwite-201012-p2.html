			<p>Rectangles can be constructed out of smaller squares. Given a supply of unit squares (1×1 in size), how many unique rectangles can be constructed?</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each an integer 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 1000 representing the number of unit squares available.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each being the number of unique rectangles that can be constructed from <em>up to <var>N</var></em> unit squares (not all squares have to be used for some of the rectangles).</p>
			<p><em>Note:</em> A rectangle is unique if another rectangle that had previously been constructed can’t be rotated to look the same way. That is, 2×3 and 3×2 are considered to be the same.</p>
