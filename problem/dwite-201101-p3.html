		<p>The binary weight of a number is the amount of 1s in the number’s binary representation. For example, 43 in binary is 101011, so its binary weight is 4. Given a decimal number, we want to find the next greater decimal number that has the same binary weight. In this case, 45 (101101<sub>2</sub>) is such a number.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, integers 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 1,000,000,000.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT3.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each corresponding to the next decimal number with the same binary weight as in the input.</p>
		<p><em>Reminder:</em> The binary representation of a number is the sum of powers of 2, where 1 means that power is included and 0 means that it’s not. So, 43 in binary is 1×2<sup>5</sup> + 0×2<sup>4</sup> + 1×2<sup>3</sup> + 0×2<sup>2</sup> + 1×2<sup>1</sup> + 1×2<sup>0</sup>, which evaluates to 1×32 + 0×16 + 1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 1×2 = 32 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 43 (101011<sub>2</sub>).</p>
