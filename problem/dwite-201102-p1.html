		<p>
			Colour has often been added to words to make them seem more attractive or distinct (take the Google logo for example). However, taking a look at coloured words under coloured light makes the letters in the word that has the same colour as the light seem invisible. For example, say I have the word 'DWITE', and its letters are coloured blue, red, red, green and blue respectively. If you looked at the word under red light, you would only see 'D__TE' (note the underscores, representing positions, where the 'W' and 'I' have been). Given coloured words and the light they are observed under, determine what you would see.
		</p>

		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. The first line of each test case consists of two words (strings with no spaces) <strong>W</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, representing the word and the colour of each letter of the word respectively (so the i<sup>th</sup> letter of <strong>C</strong> determines the colour of the i<sup>th</sup> letter of <strong>W</strong>, where the possible colours are 'b' for blue, 'r' for red, and 'g' for green). The next line contains a string <strong>L</strong>, representing the colour of the light. L consists of either a 'b', 'r', or 'g' (representing blue, red and green), or any combination of these letters separated by '+'s.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> should consist of 5 lines, where each line contains the given word as it appears under the given light. Invisible letters are to be represented with _ underscores.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <em>Note:</em> There are 3 under scores after 'Compu' in the third line of output, and the last line of output contains 5 under scores. It is also assumed that combined colours remove letters of either individual component in the combination.
