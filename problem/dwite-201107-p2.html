		<p>Definition (from Wikipedia):</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A natural number is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is bigger than one and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 5 is prime, since no number except 1 and 5 divides it. On the other hand, 6 is not a prime (it is composite), since 6 = 2 × 3.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each line having an integer <var>N</var> with 5 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 10000.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines. Each line contains the sum of the primes less than the corresponding <var>N</var> in DATA2.txt.</p>
