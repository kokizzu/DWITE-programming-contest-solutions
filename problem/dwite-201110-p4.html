		<p>According to recent surveys run by various Computer Science Clubs at Canadian high schools, 0 is a cool digit. That's why we are going to define the "coolness" of a number to be the number of 0s it has (e.g. 100 has a coolness of 2, whereas 1 has no coolness). This makes counting a very cool activity, which begs the question: exactly how cool is it to be able to count up to <strong>N</strong>? We are interested in finding the total coolness of all numbers from 0 up to a given number.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases, each a line with a single number 0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10,000,000</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, the sum of the coolness of all the numbers from 0 to <strong>N</strong> inclusive.</p>
