			<p>According to recent surveys run by various computer science clubs at Canadian high schools, 0 is a cool digit. That’s why we are going to define the “coolness” of a number to be the number of 0s it has (e.g. 100 has a coolness of 2, whereas 1 has no coolness). This makes counting a very cool activity, which raises the question: Exactly how cool is it to be able to count up to <var>N</var>? We are interested in finding the total coolness of all numbers from 0 up to a given number.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases, each being a line with a single number 0 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 10,000,000.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, the sum of the coolness of all the numbers from 0 to <var>N</var> inclusive.</p>
