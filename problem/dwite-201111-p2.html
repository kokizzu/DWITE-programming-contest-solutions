			<p>The economically questionable lottery business is making a mass-produced rectangular scratch card. It consists of a grid of hidden upper-case letters; you win by scratching letters so that they form a certain phrase, also consisting of upper-case letters. It might look like this one, where you would like to find the phrase "DWITEISAWESOMEHAHA":</p>

			<p>You would like to mass produce correctly scratched scratch cards to sell in the black market. To do this, you would like to have a stencil of the same size as the grid. For example, using this stencil, where '.' means "scratch" and '#' means "donâ€™t scratch":</p>
			<pre>.####.
##.##.
.#.#..
.#.#..
......</pre>
			<p>You obtain the correct solution:</p>
			<pre>D####W
##I##T
E#I#SA
W#E#SO
MEHAHA</pre>
			<p>Given a grid of letters and a phrase, you would like to construct a stencil to solve this puzzle. If, in fact, there is no solution, you should output a stencil with letter <strong>x</strong> for each spot.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each test case will begin with a line of two space-separated integers 1 &lt;= <strong>H, W</strong> &lt;= 10, the height and width of the grid. The next <strong>H</strong> lines will contain <strong>W</strong> upper-case letters each, describing the grid of letters. The final line of each test case will be a single string of upper-case letters, the solution string.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 sets of stencils, as described above. You may assume that solutions are unique. Refer to the sample examples for the output format.</p>
