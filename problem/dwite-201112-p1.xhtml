			<p>This <em>non-discriminatory year-end holiday season</em>, you have received a present. It has to stay neatly wrapped for some time, but you want to know what it is <em>now</em>. Estimating the weight of the package and the weights of possible presents, pick the closest match.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases, each 5 lines long. The first line will be an integer value, the weight of the package. The following 4 lines will be possible choices, each in form <var>name</var> <var>weight</var>, where <var>name</var> is a single word and <var>weight</var> is an integer weight for this choice.</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each being the name of the closest guess out of the choices. If two items tie, then answer with the heavier of the two.</p>
