		<p>It's the night before DWITE, and we're a question short. I just finished my exams a few hours ago, but AJ is <em>gone</em>, studying somewhere in the bowels of the university's campus. Though instead of recycling an old question, here's a new one, albeit with a generic story.</p>
		<p>You suddenly find yourself to be at letter A and also in a maze. Your task is to locate letter B, then letter C, then return to your starting point. Why are you doing this? <em>I don't know.</em> But you need to also find the shortest distance that this can be accomplished in.</p>
		<ul>
			<li># - wall</li>
			<li>. - open space</li>
			<li>ABC - various points of interest</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can move only up/down/left/right, not through walls, and not outside of the maze's bounds.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each case will start with 2 space-separated integers 1 &lt;= R, C &lt;= 10, rows and columns that describe the size of a maze, followed by R lines, each C characters long -- the actual maze.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each being the shortest distance for the A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A circuit.</p>
