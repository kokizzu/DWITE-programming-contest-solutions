		<p>
			Once upon a time, humans entertained themselves by non-electronic means, and crosswords flourished as a form of entertainment. Crosswords are rectangular grids with white and black squares. They look like this:

		<p>
			Given the layout of a crossword grid, we wish to count the number of “across” words and “down” words. Now, let's define a word:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			- A word is a sequence of at least 2 adjacent white squares that lie on the same horizontal (“across”) or vertical (“down”) line.
		</p>
		<p>
			- A word must not be contained completely within another word. That is, there must be no white squares available to extend the word in either direction.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the example above, there are 3 “across” words (starting at numbers 1, 3, and 4) and 2 “down” clues (starting at numbers 1 and 2).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each test case will begin with two integers, denoting <strong>H</strong> and <strong>W</strong> respectively, the height and width of the grid. Neither dimension will exceed 100. <strong>H</strong> lines will follow, each consisting of <strong>W</strong> characters, describing the layout of the grid, where ‘#’ represents a black square and ‘.’ represents a white square.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each containing 2 space-separated integers: the number of “across” words and the number of “down” words.
