			<p>For your math homework this week, your teacher gave you five large numbers, and asked you to find their prime factors. However, these numbers aren’t <em>nearly</em> large enough for someone with knowledge of programming like yourself. So, you decide to take the factorial of each of these numbers. Recall that <var>N</var>! (<var>N</var> factorial) is the product of the integers from 1 through <var>N</var>. It’s your job now to create a program to help you do your homework.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA2.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each test case contains a number <var>N</var> (2 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 10000).</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT2.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, each representing the prime factorization of factorial of the given number, which should be of the form: <var>p</var><sub>1</sub>^<var>e</var><sub>1</sub> * <var>p</var><sub>2</sub>^<var>e</var><sub>2</sub> * ... * <var>p</var><sub><var>k</var></sub>^<var>e</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> where <var>p</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>p</var><sub>2</sub>, ..., <var>p</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> are the distinct prime factors of the given number in increasing order, and <var>e</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>e</var><sub>2</sub>, ..., <var>e</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> are their exponents.</p>
