		<p>
Little Alice and Little Bob are playing with their favourite toys, Lego blocks. They have <strong>N</strong> blocks of various heights, arranged in a row. They decide to play a game with their blocks.
		</p>
		<p>
		Alice and Bob take turns removing one Lego block from the row, with Alice going first. At the beginning of a player’s turn, if the blocks form a ladder - a sequence of either non-increasing or non-decreasing heights - that player loses. Given the heights of the initial row of blocks, determine who has the winning strategy, if they play optimally.
		</p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases, and each test case describes 3 games. The first line of each game contains a number <strong>N</strong> (1 &le; <strong>N</strong> &le; 15), the number of blocks in that game. The next line contains <strong>N</strong> space-separated integers, representing the heights of the blocks, which will be integers from 0 to 100 inclusive.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, with strings of 3 characters each. The i<sup>th</sup> character of the j<sup>th</sup> line should represent the result of the i<sup>th</sup> game of the j<sup>th</sup> test case: ‘A’ if Little Alice wins, and ‘B’ if Little Bob wins.
