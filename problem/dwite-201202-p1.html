			<p>DWITE has traditionally been a high school level contest, so to ensure that no middle schoolers try to sneak in and make older students feel uncomfortable, an <em>age gate</em> is being considered.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines, each having 3 integers representing a person’s birth date, in the format <var>DD</var> <var>MM</var> <var>YYYY</var> (separated by spaces).</p>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT1.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output, which are decisions of whether the participant is at least 13 years old as of today (27 10 2010) or not. Print <em>old enough</em> or <em>too young</em> depending on the age.</p>
			<section class="sample">
