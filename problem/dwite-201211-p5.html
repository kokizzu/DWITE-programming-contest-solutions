		<p>‘Car-hopping’ is a common pastime of programmers that involves them hopping atop of cars parked in a lot (it gives them something to do while <a href="http://xkcd.com/303/" title="XKCD">waiting for their code to compile</a>). After having received multiple complaints, the parking lot company decided to hire guards to stand on top of cars to prevent programmers from car-hopping. However, there are certain factors the guards should take into account:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the lot that they are guarding there are <strong>N</strong> cars in a row, each of a certain height.</li>
			<li>Due to the heavy fog in the area, the guards can only monitor the tops of the cars that are up to <strong>S</strong> spots away from them.</li>
			<li>No guard can see past a car (no matter how close it is to them) that has a height greater than the car they are standing on.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Given the predicament they are in, the company decides to hire a programmer (one of the founders of <em>‘car-hopping’</em> nonetheless!) to help them determine the minimum number of guards needed.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA5.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. The first line of each test case contains 2 numbers separated by a space: 1 ≤ <strong>N, M</strong> ≤ 1000, which are the <strong>N</strong>umber of cars in the lot and the <strong>M</strong>aximum distance the guards can see in the fog. The following <strong>N</strong> lines will contain a single integer 1 ≤ <strong>H</strong> ≤ 1000, the <strong>H</strong>eight of each car, in order.</p>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT5.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output. Each line is a single integer representing the minimum number of guards necessary to monitor the parking lot for the corresponding case.</p>

		<p><em>Notes:</em> In the first case, a single guard can be placed on the middle car, and the range of 2 in each direction will cover the entire lot. In the second case such strategy will not work, as a guard in the middle (height 3) is blocked by the following car (height 4) from monitoring the last car of the lot.</p>
