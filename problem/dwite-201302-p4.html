		<p>In a typical "build a fence" scenario, farmer John needs to fence his animals in the cheapest way possible. In this case, <em>"the cheapest"</em> is defined as keeping them in the smallest area possible. (Well, <em>somebody</em> is buying those non-free-range products...) You observe that while it’s simple to just box every marked location at the perimeter, some of the fencing is redundant. To be specific, if two perimeter <strong>non-corner</strong> segments overlap, than that space doesn’t require a fence. E.g.</p>
		<pre>........    FFFFFFFF
.#.#..#. => F#.#FF#F
........    FFFFFFFF</pre>
		<p>Wanting to enclose # locations, the only empty space remaining is the omitted fence. The rightmost # is completely enclosed (you can imagine that FF leaves enough space to have a pathway in between). Make sure to think through all the various configurations that might need to be fenced.</p>
		<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each case will start with a line containing a single number 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 15 representing the length of the side of John’s square farm, followed by <var>N</var> lines describing the layout of the animals.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>. — empty location</li>
			<li># — an animal</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output. Each denotes the amount of fencing required to completely enclose all animals as described above.</p>

				<pre>5

				Sample Explanation – the outside of the grid must still be fenced:

.F.FFFF
