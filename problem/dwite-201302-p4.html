		<p>
			In a typical "build a fence" scenario, farmer John needs to fence his animals in the cheapest way possible. In this case, <em>"the cheapest"</em> is defined as keeping them in the smallest area possible. (Well, <em>somebody</em> is buying those non-free-range products...) You observe that while it's simple to just box every marked location at the perimeter, some of the fencing is redundant. To be specific, if two perimeter <strong>non-corner</strong> segments overlap, than that space doesn't require a fence. E.g.
		</p>
		<pre>
........    FFFFFFFF
.#.#..#. => F#.#FF#F
........    FFFFFFFF 
		</pre>
		<p>
			Wanting to enclose # locations, the only empty space remaining is the omitted fence. The rightmost # is completely enclosed (you can imagine that FF leaves enough space to have a pathway in between). Make sure to think through all the various configurations that might need to be fenced.
		</p>
		<p>
			The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each case will start with a line containing a single number 1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 15 representing the length of the side of John's square farm, followed by <em>N</em> lines describing the layout of the animals.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>. — empty location</li>
			<li># — an animal</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output. Each denotes the amount of fencing required to completely enclose all animals as described above.
