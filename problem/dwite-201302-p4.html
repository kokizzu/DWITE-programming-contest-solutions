			<p>In a typical “build a fence” scenario, farmer John needs to fence his animals in the cheapest way possible. In this case, <em>“the cheapest”</em> is defined as keeping them in the smallest area possible. (Well, <em>somebody</em> is buying those non-free-range products...) You observe that while it’s simple to just box every marked location at the perimeter, some of the fencing is redundant. To be specific, if two perimeter <em>non-corner</em> segments overlap, then that space doesn’t require a fence. For example:</p>
			<pre>........    FFFFFFFF
.#.#..#. => F#.#FF#F
........    FFFFFFFF</pre>
			<p>Wanting to enclose # locations, the only empty space remaining is the omitted fence. The rightmost # is completely enclosed (you can imagine that FF leaves enough space to have a pathway in between). Make sure to think through all the various configurations that might need to be fenced.</p>
			<p>The input file <strong>DATA4.txt</strong> will contain 5 test cases. Each case will start with a line containing a single number 1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 15 representing the length of the side of John’s square farm, followed by <var>N</var> lines describing the layout of the animals.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>. – empty location</li>
				<li># – an animal</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The output file <strong>OUT4.txt</strong> will contain 5 lines of output. Each denotes the amount of fencing required to completely enclose all animals in the scheme described above.</p>
			<section class="sample">
				<div class="input">
					Sample Input (first case shown):
					<pre>5
#.#..
.##..
.....
.#..#
...#.</pre>
				</div>
				<div class="output">
					Sample Output (first case shown):
					<pre>25</pre>
				</div>
			</section>
			<p>Sample Explanation – the outside of the grid must still be fenced:</p>
			<pre>FFFFF..
F#.#F..
FF##F..
.F.FFFF
.F#F.#F
.FFF#FF
...FFF.</pre>
